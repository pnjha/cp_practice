At the Spam Conference held at MIT in 2004 John Graham-Cumming presented two possible attacks on POPFile's Bayesian engine.[1] One was unsuccessful and the other worked, but was impractical. In doing this they identified two types of poisoning attack: passive (where words are added without any feedback to the spammer) and active (where the spammer gets feedback after the spam has been received).
