// Sliding Window Maximum

// Given an array nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right.
// You can only see the k numbers in the window.
// Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.
// Return the max sliding window.

// Example:

// Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,-2,5,3,6,7], and k = 3
// Output: [3,3,-1,5,5,6,7]
